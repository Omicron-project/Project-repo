# 🥦 Emissions Calculator for Recipes

A simple web application that helps users estimate the carbon footprint of their meals. The calculator takes ingredients and servings as input and provides total emissions per serving, along with a visual indication of climate impact.

This project was developed during the final sprint of our Data Engineer Academy. The goal was to apply our learning in sustainability, data engineering, and user-centered design to create a meaningful and functional tool.
